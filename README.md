This updated edition of Hands-On RTOS with Microcontrollers is packed with cutting-edge content. It can help you expand your skills and stay ahead of the curve in embedded-systems development. It’s written by senior engineers with decades of experience in embedded systems and related technologies. The book covers the role of real-time OSs in today’s time-critical applications, and it covers FreeRTOS, including key capabilities and APIs. You’ll find a detailed overview of system design (FreeRTOS and its APIs, memory management);  hands-on system use; as well as the hardware platform (dev-board, MCU and debug-probe), and development tools (IDE, build system, and debugging tools).

This second edition teaches you how to implement over 20 real-world embedded applications with the latest FreeRTOS features and how to optimize your code with dynamic analysis. The chapters include example programs on GitHub with detailed instructions. You’ll create and install your own FreeRTOS system on the dev-board and set up an IDE project with debugging tools. With dozens of reference manuals listed, you’ll always have ample resources for system development.

By the end of this book, you’ll have the hands-on skills to design, build, and optimize embedded applications using FreeRTOS, dev-boards, and modern debugging tools.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To run the example-programs, an STM32 Nucleo-F767ZI dev-board is needed. In the future, if additional hardware is supported, it will be described here in the book’s GitHub repository. The example-programs can be downloaded from here, in the book’s GitHub repository.. This is described in chapter 3.

_Jim Yuill_ Jim Yuill is a senior computer-systems engineer, with 30 years of experience. He has worked in operating-systems development, cyber-security R&D, network systems-programming, and university teaching. He has a PhD in computer science, with a thesis in cyber security, which is highly cited.

_Penn Linder_ Penn Linder is a Senior Electrical Engineer at IVEK Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial pumps and controllers. He has had a passion for embedded systems since taking his first embedded controllers' class at Penn State University in 1995. He followed his passion by working for various companies that allowed him to design both hardware and software for products using embedded systems. Some of the products he has worked on include lighting controls, medical devices, and industrial automation equipment. His early years were spent cranking out bare-metal assembly code for 8-bit MCUs. In his later years, he wrote software using C and FreeRTOS for 32-bit ARM Cortex-M processors.
