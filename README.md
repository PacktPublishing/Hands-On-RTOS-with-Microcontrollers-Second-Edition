 This updated edition of *Hands-On RTOS with Microcontrollers* is packed with essential content.  It can help you expand your skills and stay ahead of the curve in embedded-systems development. It’s written by senior engineers with decades of experience in embedded systems and related technologies. The book covers the role of real-time OSs in today’s time-critical applications, and it covers FreeRTOS, including key capabilities and APIs. You’ll find detailed descriptions of system design,  hands-on system use, the hardware platform (dev-board, MCU, and debug-probe), and the development tools (IDE, build system, and debugging tools).

This second edition teaches you how to implement over 20 real-world embedded applications, using FreeRTOS's primary features. The chapters include example programs on GitHub, with detailed instructions. You’ll create and install your own FreeRTOS system on the dev-board (purchased separately), and set up an IDE project with debugging tools. 

An ST dev-board is used with the book, and it is purchased separately (STM32 Nucleo-F767ZI). (Though, the dev-board is not required to read and understand the book.)

By the end of this book, you’ll have the hands-on skills to start designing, building, and optimizing embedded applications, using FreeRTOS, development boards, and debugging tools.

_Jim Yuill_ Jim Yuill is a senior computer-systems engineer, with 30 years of experience. He has worked in operating-systems development, cyber-security R&D, network systems-programming, and university teaching. He has a PhD in computer science, with a thesis in cyber security, which is highly cited.

_Penn Linder_ Penn Linder is a Senior Electrical Engineer at IVEK Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial pumps and controllers. He has had a passion for embedded systems since taking his first embedded controllers' class at Penn State University in 1995. He followed his passion by working for various companies that allowed him to design both hardware and software for products using embedded systems. Some of the products he has worked on include lighting controls, medical devices, and industrial automation equipment. His early years were spent cranking out bare-metal assembly code for 8-bit MCUs. In his later years, he wrote software using C and FreeRTOS for 32-bit ARM Cortex-M processors.
