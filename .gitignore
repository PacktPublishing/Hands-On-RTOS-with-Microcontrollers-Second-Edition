# .gitignore Patterns
# * https://linuxize.com/post/gitignore-ignoring-files-in-git/
# * Slashes (from link above)
#   * "If the pattern ends with a slash, it matches only directories."
#   * "If the pattern starts with a slash, it matches files and directories only in the repository root."
# * Negating Patterns
#   * "A pattern that starts with an exclamation mark (!) negates (re-include) any file that is ignored 
#     by the previous pattern. The exception to this rule is to re-include a file if its parent directory 
#     is excluded."

#
# Workspace rules
# * For projects with multiple build-configurations, they have their own .gitignore file
#

# Folder with IDE configuration settings, for the workspace
/.metadata/


#
# Project-level rules
#

# Debug and Release directories have build artifacts
/Chapter_*/Debug/
/Chapter_*/Release/
/FreeRTOS_project/Debug/
/FreeRTOS_project/Release/

# This file records the files created for code generation.  
# * Full-paths are specified, so the file isn't portable to other systems.
/Chapter_*/.mxproject
/FreeRTOS_project/.mxproject

# Folder with IDE configuration settings, for the project
# * Remove everything in .settings folder, except the file org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs
# * That file has the text-encoding setting, which is needed to avoid build warnings.
